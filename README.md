    # TraitForge - A Combinatorial Image Generator

    TraitForge is a simple Windows (.NET) desktop application written in C# that generates all possible image combinations from a given set of layered traits. It's designed for artists and creators, especially for projects like generating NFT collections or layered character sprites.

    *(Here you should insert a screenshot of the app in action. Even if the GUI is basic, showing it is better than not showing it.)*

    ### The Story & Current Status

    This application was originally developed as a custom tool for a client. The core functionality is complete and working, but the project was halted before any significant UI/UX refinement.

    As such, the Graphical User Interface is very basic and "developer-focused". **Functionality was prioritized over aesthetics.**

    I am publishing it as a portfolio piece to showcase my skills in C# and .NET desktop development.

    ### 🚧 Known Issues & Potential Improvements

    *   **UI/UX:** The entire user interface is a placeholder and needs a complete redesign to be user-friendly.
    *   **Instructions:** There are minimal instructions within the app itself.
    *   **Error Handling:** Error handling is very basic.

    I don't have active plans to develop this further, but **I'm open to contributions!** If you are a UI/UX designer or a C# developer who finds this project interesting, feel free to fork it or submit a Pull Request.
